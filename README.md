# README

**Warning:** Very raw and unmaintained code. Use at your own risk. Mainly
intended as a starting point.

## What is it?

## Contributions

1. Fork the `develop` branch.
2. Stage your files: `git add path/to/file.py`.
3. `bash scripts/pre.sh`, this will format, lint, and test the code. Note, that
   you will need a `COMFY_API_URL` environment variable set to a ComfyUI server
   for the tests.
4. `git status` check if anything changed, if so, `git add` the changes, and go
   back to the previous step.
5. `git commit -m "..."`.
6. Make a PR to `develop`.
